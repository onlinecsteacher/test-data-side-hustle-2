# test-data-side-hustle-2

Notes/Open Questions:
- This code requires using loops which students haven't yet learned. How should students evaluate the AI-generated steps to determine if they're feasible?
- Would we expect students to manually add data entries? Or would this form be a feature to add to an existing webpage display, e.g. <a href="https://onlinecsteacher.github.io/test-data-side-hustle/">Teen Opportunities Dashboard</a>
