### User Input

In the script.js file, create a commented out To Do list for a beginner coder to add in vanilla JS to build out a form. It should take in each of the following information in a new field: Title,Category Type,Barrier to Entry,Helps with College Admissions,Technical and Skills Required,Non-financial Benefits

Do NOT write any code, just a list of steps to complete

### Planner Response

I'll create a commented todo list in the script.js file for building a form to handle the side hustle employability data. Let me update my todo list first and then add the commented steps.

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive commented todo list in your [script.js](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle2/script.js:0:0-0:0) file that breaks down the form development process into 8 manageable steps for a beginner coder.

## Todo List Overview

The commented guide covers:

* **TODO 1-2**: Basic form structure and input field creation for all 6 data categories
* **TODO 3-4**: Form validation and submission handling  
* **TODO 5-6**: Data storage, display, and management features
* **TODO 7-8**: UX enhancements and advanced features

Each step includes specific sub-tasks and considers the exact field types needed based on your CSV data (dropdowns for categorical data like "Low/Medium/High", text inputs for open-ended fields).

The todo list progresses logically from basic form creation to advanced features like data persistence and visualization, making it perfect for a beginner to follow step-by-step.

## Task Completion Status

create a commented out plan for students to add in a form where users can enter a new row of data to the dataset that includes the following information:  Title,Category Type,Barrier to Entry,Helps with College Admissions,Technical and Skills Required,Non-financial Benefits

Do NOT write any code, just a series of comments describing what code students need to add in. Use the following as an example: 
//1) Create a variable called "mouse" and store a sprite in it 

//2) Set the animation to "mouse" and set the size

//3) Call the draw function, set the background and make the mouse move foward

//4) Add one more line of code to make the mouse move diagonally.

### User Input

how do i create an object in javascript to store user input data?

### Planner Response

In JavaScript, you create an object using curly braces `{}` and store key-value pairs using colons `:` (not equals signs `=`).

Here's how to fix the object creation in your code:

*Proposed code*

### Planner Response

To create an object in JavaScript, you use curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons `:`, not equals signs `=`.

## Correct Object Syntax

```javascript
const newEntry = {
    title: title,
    categoryType: categoryType,
    barrierToEntry: barrierToEntry,
    collegeAdmissions: collegeAdmissions,
    technicalSkills: technicalSkills,
    nonFinancialBenefits: nonFinancialBenefits
};
```

## Key Points

* **Use colons `:` not equals `=`** for property assignment
* **Separate properties with commas `,`**
* **Use `const` or `let`** to declare the variable
* **Property names** (left side) can be strings or identifiers
* **Property values** (right side) are your variables

## Alternative Shorthand (ES6)
If your property names match your variable names exactly, you can use shorthand:

```javascript
const newEntry = {
    title,
    categoryType,
    barrierToEntry,
    collegeAdmissions,
    technicalSkills,
    nonFinancialBenefits
};
```

This creates the same object with less typing!

### User Input

how do i add a new object to my array?

### Planner Response

Perfect! You've already correctly added a new object to your array using the `push()` method:

```javascript
dataEntries.push(newEntry)
```

## How `push()` Works

The `push()` method adds one or more elements to the **end** of an array and returns the new length of the array.

## Syntax Options

```javascript
// Add one object
dataEntries.push(newEntry);

// Add multiple objects at once
dataEntries.push(entry1, entry2, entry3);

// You can also push objects directly
dataEntries.push({
    title: "New Title",
    categoryType: "Job"
});
```

## Other Array Methods for Adding Elements

* **`unshift()`** - Adds to the beginning of array
* **`splice()`** - Adds at specific position
* **Spread operator** - `dataEntries = [...dataEntries, newEntry]`

Your current code correctly uses `push(newEntry)` which will add each new form submission to the end of your `dataEntries` array!

### Planner Response

Perfect! I've created an HTML form that matches all the data fields in your [script.js](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle2/script.js:0:0-0:0) file. Here's what the form includes:

## Form Fields Created

* **Category Type** - Dropdown with options: Job, Internship, Volunteering, Club
* **Barrier to Entry** - Dropdown with options: Low, Medium, High  
* **Helps with College Admissions** - Dropdown with options: Low, Medium, High
* **Technical Skills** - Text input field
* **Non-financial Benefits** - Text input field

## Key Features

* **Form ID**: `side-hustle-form` (ready for event listeners)
* **Matching IDs**: All input IDs exactly match your `document.getElementById()` calls
* **Required fields**: All inputs have `required` attribute for basic validation
* **Display area**: Added `entries-display` section for showing submitted data
* **Linked files**: Connected to [styles.css](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle2/styles.css:0:0-0:0) and [script.js](cci:7://file:///Users/emmawingreen/Desktop/tutorial/data-side-hustle2/script.js:0:0-0:0)

The form is now ready to work with your JavaScript code. The IDs match perfectly with your `document.getElementById()` calls in the script.

## Task Completion Status
✅ HTML form created with all required fields matching the script.js data collection structure.
